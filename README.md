Cohortize is dedicated at providing a proper platform for coders to collaborate. 
There are a lot of places like Linkedin, Github, Discord where you can collab with others on projects but none of them have a dedicated system for it.
Me myself being a beginner faced a lot of issues while trying to get into open source, github is a really nice platform for open-source but it looks really wild from outside, beginners usually decide to take part in open-source initiatives but back out seeing the complex processes and procedures. So, Cohortize aims at providing a ladder with shorter steps to make it easier for beginners to get into coding.
